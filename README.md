## CamlPhysX

* A physics engine developed in ocaml

* This file is a more like notes to me than readme (i dont expect people to read this as of now)

### A rough idea map of the engine

* any physics engine from what i understood so far has 3 parts
1. Move objects by applying forces and based on the set physical rules of the system
2. Detect colisions
3. Resolve colisions
